### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a remote sensing and machine learning researcher working towards improved modelling of freshwater systems. My current position is with the Data Science Branch of the Water Missions area in the US Geological Survey. I always love to chat about potential collaborations, cool data science topics, or potentially under utilized datasets.  Feel free to reach out if you ever stumble upon my Github and have any questions.
