### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am mainly a remote sensing researcher who works with big data and machine learning to uncover macroscale patterns in freshwater resources.  I always love to chat about potential collaborations, cool data science topics, or potentially under utilized datasets.  Feel free to reach out if you ever stumble upon my Github and have any questions.
